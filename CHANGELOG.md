# VERSION HISTORY

- 1.5.1 (2021-03-05)
  - Fix extraction error for WMT18 extra test sets (test-ts) (#142)
  - Validation and test datasets are added for multilingual TEDx

- 1.5.0 (2021-01-15)
  - Fix an assertion error in chrF (#121)
  - Add missing `__repr__()` methods for BLEU and TER
  - TER: Fix exception when `--short` is used (#131)
  - Pin Mecab version to 1.0.3 for Python 3.5 support
  - [API Change]: Default value for `floor` smoothing is now 0.1 instead of 0.
  - [API Change]: `sacrebleu.sentence_bleu()` now uses the `exp` smoothing method,
    exactly the same as the CLI's --sentence-level behavior. This was mainly done
    to make two methods behave the same.
  - Add smoothing value to BLEU signature (#98)

    - Fixed bug that only applied smoothing to n-grams for n > 2
    - Added default smoothing values for methods "floor" (0) and "add-k" (1)
  - `--list` now returns a list of all language pairs for a task when combined with `-t`
    (e.g., `sacrebleu -t wmt19 --list`)
  - added missing languages for IWSLT17

  - Bugfix: call to sentence_bleu (thanks to Rachel Bawden)
  - Documentation example for Python API (thanks to Vlad Lyalin)

   - Added sentence-level scoring via -sl (--sentence-level)

- 1.4.0 (2019-09-10)
   - Many thanks to Martin Popel for all the changes below!
   - Added evaluation on concatenated test sets (e.g., `-t wmt17,wmt18`).
     Works as long as they all have the same language pair.
   - Added `sacrebleu --origlang` (both for evaluation on a subset and for `--echo`).
     Note that while echoing prints just the subset, evaluation expects the complete
     test set (and just skips the irrelevant parts).
   - Added `sacrebleu --detail` for breakdown by domain-specific subsets of the test sets.
     (Available for WMT19).
   - Minor changes
     - Improved display of `sacrebleu -h`
     - Added `sacrebleu --list`
     - Code refactoring
     - Documentation and tests updates
     - Fixed a race condition bug (`os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)` instead of `if os.path.exists`)

- 1.3.7 (2019-07-12)
   - Lazy loading of regexes cuts import time from ~1s to nearly nothing (thanks, @louismartin!)
   - Added a simple (non-atomic) lock on downloading
   - Can now read multiple refs from a single tab-delimited file.
     You need to pass `--num-refs N` to tell it to run the split.
     Only works with a single reference file passed from the command line.
